# FOLDER SYNC
This is a folder synchronization project in Python that periodically and automatically synchronizes files between two folders, while recording operations into a log file.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Inside the main folder, there are two folders(source_folder and replica_folder) that were used to demonstrate the code in full operation, simply inserting
 "python app.py source_folder replica_folder log_file/sync_log.txt" into the terminal .
3. To use the program to synchronize any two folders, simply replace the name of the respective folders with the path of the desired folders.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Python standard libraries
